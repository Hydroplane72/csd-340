### Topic # 23 Memory Takes a Lot of Mental Resources

#### Embellishment
This is an exciting chapter in my mind, and it applies to me quite a bit. Recently, I had to sit through a 3-day course at work on using AI and creating AI agents for work purposes. I remember portions of the first two days; most of my memory of that class is on the third day, though. Following what the book calls the "recency effect." At the same time, the book example was about a quick conference. Mine took place over a longer time, and the same result still happened compared to the book.

The first day was about using the Copilot AI in Visual Studio Code to do your work for you. All of us in that class basically remember that first day as the day we learned to vibe Code. It was fun having permission to vibe Code for a full 8 hours of my day.

The second day centered on how to create AI Copilot-based agents using Code. For those who wonder, at the bottom of this, I will include a link to a web page on how to make AI agents using Code. At the same time, it is an interesting thing to learn. I remember that you can make agents using JavaScript, TypeScript, or C#. I could not tell you more about how to create an agent from Code if I tried. 

The Third day I remember best because it showed us how we can use Copilot Studio to create agents from a UI instead of from Code. It is much easier and more efficient to make changes in the UI than to figure out where you need to go in the agent code's folder structure.



#### Visual Example

The example I found is Yale's Art School page. Anyone enrolled in the school has access to this page and can edit just about anything they wish. It is undoubtedly an interesting webpage with quite a bit of ... character. This web page belongs to this topic primarily because of the amount of noise it contains. I also want to note how much duplicate information is present throughout the website. This makes sense if students have to make changes to this website as part of school assignments.

### Topic # 25 It's a Good Thing that People Forget.

I want to expand more on the options you can give your users and help them with data entry. A recent update my team made to an application included a feature that displays address suggestions to agents as they type. What this does is reduce the number of "bad" addresses where the agent and/or client enter an invalid address. I will only mention this if you implement it at your workplace: make sure your systems can handle people's complete addresses. Some older systems can only take so many characters for address lines. This may or may not have caused issues at my work. The main point I am trying to make is that your dropdown options in UI's don't have to be static values. You can update those values as people type to make the experience feel more personal.

Another tip I would like to expand on is that people tend to forget what they last chose. In my case, I have to show multiple forms to users that can contain duplicate data. To help ease the load of remembering previous answers. We actually built a system that remembers an answer to a question and pre-populates that answer for similar questions on other forms. Before you ask, this is a design requirement at my work for regulatory reasons. We are not allowed to ask questions and then fill in the answers on the forms.  

With that said, the best question-and-answer system is one where you can ask the client the same question once and never need to ask it again. For example, for financial planners, it looks better on them if, in your first meeting, you go through the entire data entry process. Then, in your second meeting, potentially the following year, it should be expected that the financial planner only needs to ask what has changed. This provides a professional look and makes it seem like you actually care about the client.
