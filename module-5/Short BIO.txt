Shirley Rozendaal,

Born and raised in the wide‑open countryside of Iowa, she looks back on her early years as peaceful, secure, and surrounded by a family that cared deeply for her. She remembers that most of her childhood was filled with exploring the outdoors and playing with her dolls. Along with time spent getting into harmless mischief with cousins, this shaped a personality rooted in creativity, curiosity, and warmth.

Some of her earliest memories include losing her yellow‑and‑white cat. This experience showed just how deeply she feels things and how naturally empathy comes to her. As she got older, she picked up all kinds of hobbies—gardening, reading, collecting postage stamps, and working through puzzles ranging from jigsaw pieces to Sudoku. She’s always had the heart of a collector and a storyteller, someone who takes care of the people around her and holds onto the memories that matter.

Her life has crossed paths with some of the significant moments in history—hearing the first reports of World War II, remembering exactly where she was when President Kennedy was shot, and later feeling the disbelief of 9/11. Even so, the things that make her happiest are much simpler. She enjoys pulling weeds in the garden, trying new foods, walking through the prairie grass, cheering at high school football games, and spending time with her great‑grandchildren as they grow.

Being a preacher’s wife taught her a lot about walking the line between being open and feeling like she had to look perfect all the time. Even so, she talks about her children with nothing but warmth, calling them “a delight.” Generosity has always come naturally to her—no matter the amount, from a single dollar to a million, she’d give it away to help others through groups like UMCOR. These days, she sees herself as reserved but thoughtful, most content when she’s doing something that benefits others and when she’s passing down the stories that keep her family’s history alive.
