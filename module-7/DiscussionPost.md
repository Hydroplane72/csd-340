Topic #57 - People are Inherently Lazy
Visualization:

	The visual I found goes a bit against the book's portrayal of lazy people. The video basically says that if you think people will be lazy, then they will be lazy. If you believe they're not lazy, the video claims they won't be. Now, the video is about human resources and how managers treat their employees. In some cases, though, you can follow the same guidelines for your website design. For instance, if someone is going to read a dissertation on a medical practice. They are probably ready to sit down and fully immerse themselves in the information overload about to be presented to them.

	I found this article that discusses device inertia, and it does an excellent job of explaining why users may choose to take specific actions. The main point the article was trying to make is that a user will continue down a path until "the perceived cost is too high compared with the perceived benefit". Meaning a user will continue on a device that may not be optimized for the work they are doing because they perceive the cost of changing devices to be too high compared to the benefit of being more efficient on a more optimized device.

Topic #58 - People Will Look for Shortcuts Only if the Shortcuts are Easy

Visualization
	The video I chose for this is actually a video about different keyboard shortcuts available on Windows machines. I don't own any Apple products, so I can not confirm or deny whether any of the shortcuts apply to that operating system. I chose this video mainly because many people don't know that there are actually a few out-of-the-box shortcuts available for Windows PCs. For many of us, the shortcut to copy and paste is like breathing. It isn't actually a very well-known way to copy and paste. To tie this back into design, the video shows at one point how Windows tries to teach users how to use shortcuts by placing them right next to how users go about doing the same task the "long" way.

	The second video I chose for this is to show everyone how to make users' lives easier or harder, depending on the requirements. What I am talking about is autocomplete on websites. The video provides a very brief discussion and example of how to set up autocomplete on your websites, along with a couple of options to let the browser know the type of data expected.
