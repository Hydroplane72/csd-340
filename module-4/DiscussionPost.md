Topic # 35: People are driven to create Categories.
Embellishment:
I saw this topic title and couldn't resist talking about categories. It is a very hot topic at my workplace for several reasons. One of those reasons is the need for management and other business users to categorize data using their own methods. This need, of course, is a difficult task when you have to take into account how many different ways data can be viewed and requested. One of the methods we use to provide options to our business users is to set up "Power BI" reports so they can view data their own way.

Visual
The visual I chose to use is actually a youtube video talking about Pivot tables. I view Categories as data that the user cares about. This means more than likely, the user will want to be able to view these "Categories" easily. Pivot tables and the charts associated with them provide a very good view into how important catagories are to us in our day to day life.

Topic # 34: People Learn best from Examples
Embellishment:
This topic closely affects how I learn new things. I try new things by seeing a process in action and then trying it myself. This method is in comparison to reading about a topic and trying to implement it from there. Granted, it would help if I didn't skim 90% of everything I read anyway. Having code examples and/or hands-on experiences to follow along with makes it more likely that I will expand on the basics and truly use a concept as it was meant to be used. A perfect example of this is API's. At the same time, you can read an API's documentation if the API doesn't give you JSON examples to modify and try yourself. The task of integrating with that API becomes much harder. I myself run as far away from API specs that refuse to give me examples of payloads. 
Visual
The visual I found is actually more about how people learn better when multiple methods are used to teach them new things. The video explains how just being told a fact vs. being told a fact and seeing it at the same time affects how well we learn about topics.
